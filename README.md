# fullstack-finalproject Journal
overview:

* Node.js, 
* React 
* Socket.io
* MongoDB for the database 
* by using: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript



Features:

-  1.Login and sign-up system
- Microservice:  I demonstrated how to create a simple microservice for user authentication using Auth0 as an authentication provider. This microservice will be responsible for obtaining access tokens for the chat application.
I already Tested the login route using Postman 


I was really intend to add more features like :

-  2.Individual room codes with passwords

-  3.Room-sharing links

-  4.Chat commands with a response from the system

-  5.Page for a list of open rooms


My main problem was that I coudnt navigate the singup page to the loging page, this is the error i got " [Error] Warning: You are importing createRoot from "react-dom" which is not supported. You should instead import it from "react-dom/client".
